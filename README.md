## About ##

Mastermind is a code breaking game. In this version, you will play the role of the code-breaker, and figure out the number combination of a randomly generated 4 digit 'code'. There are 6 possible numbers for each 'peg'. Each number will be displayed as either an exact match or a partial match.

- Exact: Represents number of 'pegs' that are the *correct* number and *correct* position.
- Partial: Represents number of 'pegs' that are the *correct* number, but *wrong* position.
