## Game ##

Mastermind is a code breaking game.

In this version, you will play the role of the code-breaker.

Each turn, you will try to figure out the number combination of a randomly generated 4 digit 'code'. There are 6 possible numbers for each digit of the 'code'. Each digit will be counted as either an exact match or a partial match.

- **Exact**: Represents number of digits that are the **correct** number and **correct** position.
- **Partial**: Represents number of digits that are the **correct** number, but **wrong** position.
